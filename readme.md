# Readme:

### Hello, this is the readme for my Sentenge Generator, named dSenGen.

I have not included any files at the time of writing this, and the only thing that really exists is pseudocode.

In the future, this will be a language generator.

The user will be allowed to create a language grammar (BNF) that the program will parse.  It will then do some stuff and generate a structure that represents the grammar.  Then it will generate a random sentence in the language defined by the grammar.

I am going to write it in C, and may or may not give it a GUI

Well, that's about it at this juncture.  What you see is what you get
